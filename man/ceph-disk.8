.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBceph\-disk\fP is a utility that can prepare and activate a disk, partition or
directory as a ceph OSD. It is run directly or triggered by \fBceph\-deploy\fP
or udev.
.sp
It actually automates the multiple steps involved in manual creation and start
of an OSD into 2 steps of preparing and activating the OSD by using the
subcommands \fBprepare\fP and \fBactivate\fP\&.
.SH SUBCOMMANDS
.sp
\fBprepare\fP: Prepare a directory, disk or drive for a ceph OSD. It creates a GPT
partition, marks the partition with ceph type uuid, creates a file system, marks
the file system as ready for ceph consumption, uses entire partition and adds a
new partition to the journal disk. It is run directly or triggered by
\fBceph\-deploy\fP\&.
.sp
Usage: ceph\-disk prepare \-\-cluster [cluster\-name] \-\-cluster\-uuid [uuid] \-\-fs\-type
[ext4|xfs|btrfs] [data\-path] [journal\-path]
.sp
\fBactivate\fP: Activate the ceph OSD. It mounts the volume in a temporary location,
allocates an OSD id (if needed), remounts in the correct location /var/lib/ceph/
osd/$cluster\-$id and starts ceph\-osd. It is triggered by udev when it sees the OSD
GPT partition type or on ceph service start with \(aqceph disk activate\-all\(aq. It is
also run directly or triggered by \fBceph\-deploy\fP\&.
.sp
Usage: ceph\-disk activate [data\-path]
.sp
An additional option [\-\-activate\-key PATH] has to be used with this subcommand
when a copy of /var/lib/ceph/bootstrap\-osd/{cluster}.keyring isn\(aqt present in the
OSD node.
.sp
Usage: ceph\-disk activate [data\-path] [\-\-activate\-key PATH]
.sp
\fBactivate\-journal\fP: Activate an OSD via it\(aqs journal device. udev triggers
\(aqceph\-disk activate\-journal <dev>\(aq based on the partition type.
.sp
Usage: ceph\-disk activate\-journal [DEV]
.sp
Here, [DEV] is the path to journal block device.
.sp
Others options can also be used with this subcommand like \-\-activate\-key and
\-\-mark\-init.
.sp
Usage: ceph\-disk activate\-journal [\-\-activate\-key PATH] [\-\-mark\-init INITSYSTEM]
[DEV]
.sp
\fBactivate\-all\fP: Activate all tagged OSD partitions. activate\-all relies on
/dev/disk/by\-parttype\-uuid/$typeuuid.$uuid to find all partitions. Special udev
rules is installed to create these links. It is triggered on ceph service start
up or run directly.
.sp
Usage: ceph\-disk activate\-all
.sp
\fBlist\fP: List disk partitions and ceph OSDs. It is run directly or triggered
by \fBceph\-deploy\fP\&.
.sp
Usage: ceph\-disk list
.sp
\fBsuppress\-activate\fP: Suppress activate on a device (prefix).
.sp
Usage: ceph\-disk suppress\-activate [PATH]
.sp
Here, [PATH] is path to block device or directory.
.sp
\fBunsuppress\-activate\fP: Stop suppressing activate on a device (prefix).
.sp
Usage: ceph\-disk unsuppress\-activate [PATH]
.sp
Here, [PATH] is path to block device or directory.
.sp
\fBzap\fP: Zap/erase/destroy a device\(aqs partition table and contents. It is
also run directly or triggered by \fBceph\-deploy\fP\&.
.sp
Usage: ceph\-disk zap [DEV]
.sp
Here, [DEV] is path to block device.
