#Pybind of rgw 
PyBind is a tool which can be used to generate python bindings for C or C++ APIs. pybind11 is a lightweight header-only library
that exposes C++ types in Python and vice versa, mainly to create Python bindings of existing C++ code.
Its goals and syntax are similar to the excellent [Boost python](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/libs/python/doc/). 

pybind can map the following core C++ features to Python:

- Instance methods and static methods
- Overloaded functions
- Instance attributes and static attributes
- Arbitrary exception types
- Enumerations
- Callbacks
- Iterators and ranges
- Custom operators
- Single and multiple inheritance
- STL data structures
- Iterators and ranges
- Internal references with correct reference counting
- C++ classes with virtual (and pure virtual) methods can be extended in Python
- and many more ...
