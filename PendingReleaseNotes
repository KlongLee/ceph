11.1.1

* There was a bug introduced in Jewel (#19119) that broke the mapping behavior
  when an "out" OSD that still existed in the CRUSH map was removed with 'osd rm'.
  This could result in 'misdirected op' and other errors.  The bug is now fixed,
  but the fix itself introduces the same risk because the behavior may vary between
  clients and OSDs.  To avoid problems, please ensure that all OSDs are removed
  from the CRUSH map before deleting them.  That is, be sure to do::

     ceph osd crush rm osd.123

  before::

     ceph osd rm osd.123
