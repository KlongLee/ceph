v0.70
~~~~~

* librados::Rados::pool_create_async() and librados::Rados::pool_delete_async()
  don't drop a reference to the completion object on error, caller needs to take
  care of that. This has never really worked correctly and we were leaking an
  object

* 'ceph osd crush set <id> <weight> <loc..>' no longer adds the osd to the
  specified location, as that's a job for 'ceph osd crush add'.  It will
  however continue to work just the same as long as the osd already exists
  in the crush map.

* The OSD now enforces that class write methods cannot both mutate an
  object and return data.  The rbd.assign_bid method, the lone
  offender, has been removed.  This breaks compatibility with
  pre-bobtail librbd clients by preventing them from creating new
  images.

* librados now returns on commit instead of ack for synchronous calls.
  This is a bit safer in the case where both OSDs and the client crash, and
  is probably how it should have been acting from the beginning. Users are
  unlikely to notice but it could result in lower performance in some
  circumstances. Those who care should switch to using the async interfaces,
  which let you specify safety semantics precisely.

* The C++ librados AioComplete::get_version() method was incorrectly
  returning an int (usually 32-bits).  To avoid breaking library
  compatibility, a get_version64() method is added that returns the
  full-width value.  The old method is deprecated and will be removed
  in a future release.  Users of the C++ librados API that make use of
  the get_version() method should modify their code to avoid getting a
  value that is truncated from 64 to to 32 bits.

v0.71
~~~~~

* The MDS now disallows snapshots by default as they are not
  considered stable.  The command 'ceph mds set allow_snaps' will
  enable them.

* For clusters that were created before v0.44 (pre-argonaut, Spring
  2012) and store radosgw data, the auto-upgrade from TMAP to OMAP
  objects has been disabled.  Before upgrading, make sure that any
  buckets created on pre-argonaut releases have been modified (e.g.,
  by PUTing and then DELETEing an object from each bucket).  Any
  cluster created with argonaut (v0.48) or a later release or not
  using radosgw never relied on the automatic conversion and is not
  affected by this change.

* Any direct users of the 'tmap' portion of the librados API should be
  aware that the automatic tmap -> omap conversion functionality has
  been removed.

* Most output that used K or KB (e.g., for kilobyte) now uses a
  lower-case k to match the official SI convention.  Any scripts that
  parse output and check for an upper-case K will need to be modified.
