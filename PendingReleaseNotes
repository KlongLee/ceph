* The 'mon_warn_osd_usage_min_max_delta' health warning has been disabled because
  it does not address clusters undergoing recovery or CRUSH rules that do
  not target all devices in the cluster.

* The OSDs now avoid starting new scrubs while recovery is in progress.  To
  revert to the old behavior (and do not let recovery activity affect the
  scrub scheduling) you can set the following option::

    osd scrub during recovery = true


10.2.11
-------

* The RBD C API's rbd_discard method and the C++ API's Image::discard method
  now enforce a maximum length of 2GB. This restriction prevents overflow of
  the result code.

* The maximum number of PGs per OSD before the monitor issues a
  warning has been reduced from 300 to 200 PGs.  200 is still twice
  the generally recommended target of 100 PGs per OSD.  This limit can
  be adjusted via the ``mon_pg_warn_max_per_osd`` option on the
  monitors.

* Creating pools or adjusting pg_num will now fail if the change would
  make the number of PGs per OSD exceed the configured
  ``mon_pg_warn_max_per_osd`` limit.  The option can be adjusted if it
  is really necessary to create a pool with more PGs.
