v0.78 firefly
-------------

* The default leveldb cache size for the ceph-osd daemon has been
  increased from 4 MB to 128 MB.  This will increase the memory
  footprint of that process but tends to increase performance of omap
  (key/value) objects (used for CephFS and the radosgw).  If memory in your
  deployment is tight, you can preserve the old behavio by adding::

    leveldb write buffer size = 0
    leveldb cache size = 0

  to your ceph.conf to get back the (leveldb) defaults.

* monitor 'auth' read-only commands now expect the user to have 'rx' caps.
  the affected commands are::

    ceph auth export
    ceph auth get
    ceph auth get-key
    ceph auth print-key
    ceph auth list
