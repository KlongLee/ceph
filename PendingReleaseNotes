>= 12.1.2
---------
* When running 'df' on a CephFS filesystem comprising exactly one data pool,
  the result now reflects the file storage space used and available in that
  data pool (fuse client only).
* Added new commands "pg force-recovery" and "pg-force-backfill". Use them
  to boost recovery or backfill priority of specified pgs, so they're
  recovered/backfilled before any other. Note that these commands don't
  interrupt ongoing recovery/backfill, but merely queue specified pgs
  before others so they're recovered/backfilled as soon as possible.
  New commands "pg cancel-force-recovery" and "pg cancel-force-backfill"
  restore default recovery/backfill priority of previously forced pgs.

* A first release of Ceph for FreeBSD is available which contains a full 
  set of features, other than Bluestore. It will run everything needed to
  build a storage cluster. For clients, all access methods are available,
  albeit CephFS is only accessible through a Fuse implementation. RBD images 
  can be mounted on FreeBSD systems thru rbd-ggate

  Ceph versions are released thru the regular FreeBSD ports and packages
  system. The most current version is available as: net/ceph-devel. 
  Once Luminous goes into official release, this version will be available 
  as net/ceph. Future development releases will be available via net/ceph-devel

  More details about this port are in: README.FreeBSD

* The Ceph LZ4 compression plugin is now built by default if the required
  version of the LZ4 library is available. LZ4 is not enabled in the official
  Ceph releases due to some distros shipping with a very old releases of the
  LZ4 library which does not have the required LZ4 streaming function.
