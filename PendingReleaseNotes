* Huge revamp of the 'ceph' command-line interface implementation.

* The 'ceph osd tell ...' and 'ceph mon tell ...' commands are no
  longer supported.  Any callers should use::

    ceph tell osd.<id or *> ...
    ceph tell mon.<id or name or *> ...

  The 'ceph mds tell ...' command is still there, but will soon also
  transition to 'ceph tell mds.<id or name or *> ...'
