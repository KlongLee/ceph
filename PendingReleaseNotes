v0.89
-----

* New ability to list all objects from all namespaces can fail or return
  incomplete results when not all OSDs have been upgraded.  Features
  rados --all ls, rados cppool, rados export, rados cache-flush-evict-all
  and rados cache-try-flush-evict-all can also fail or return incomplete
  results.


v0.90
-----

* Previously, the formatted output of 'ceph pg stat -f ...' was a full
  pg dump that included all metadata about all PGs in the system.  It
  is now a concise summary of high-level PG stats, just like the
  unformatted 'ceph pg stat' command.
