v0.54
-----

* The osd capabilities associated with a rados user have changed
  syntax since 0.48 argonaut. The new format is mostly backwards
  compatible, but there are two backwards-incompatible changes:

  * specifying a list of pools in one grant, i.e.
    'allow r pool=foo,bar' is now done in separate grants, i.e.
    'allow r pool=foo, allow r pool=bar'.

  * restricting pool access by pool owner ('allow r uid=foo') is
    removed. This feature was not very useful and unused in practice.

  The new format is documented in the ceph-authtool man page.

* Bug fixes to the new osd capability format parsing properly validate
  the allowed operations. If an existing rados user gets permissions
  errors after upgrading, its capabilities were probably
  misconfigured. See the ceph-authtool man page for details on osd
  capabilities.
