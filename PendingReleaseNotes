* ceph-osd now requires a max fd limit of at least
  filestore_wbthrottle_(xfs|btrfs)_inodes_hard_limit (5000 by default)
  in order to accomodate the new write back throttle system.  upstart
  now sets the fd limit to 32k.  sysvinit will set it to 32k by default
  (still overrideable via max_open_files).

* The 'ceph pg <pgid> ...' commands (like 'ceph pg <pgid> query') are
  deprecated in favor of 'ceph tell <pgid> ...'.  This makes the
  distinction between 'ceph pg <command> <pgid>' and 'ceph pg <pgid>
  <command>' less awkward by making it clearer that the 'tell'
  commands are talking to the OSD serving the placement group, not the
  monitor.

* The 'ceph --admin-daemon <path> <command ...>' used to accept the command
  and arguments as either a single string or as separate arguments.  It will
  now only accept the command spread across multiple arguments.  This means that
  any script which does something like::

    ceph --admin-daemon /var/run/ceph/ceph-osd.0.asok 'config set debug_ms 1'

  needs to remove the quotes.  Also, note that the above can now be shortened to::

    ceph daemon osd.0 config set debug_ms 1
