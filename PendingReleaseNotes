* The experimental keyvaluestore-dev OSD backend had an on-disk format
  change that prevents existing OSD data from being upgraded.  This
  affects developers and testers only.

* mon-specific and osd-specific leveldb options have been removed.
  From this point onward users should use 'leveldb_' generic options and add
  the options in the appropriate sections of their configuration files.
  Monitors will still maintain the following monitor-specific defaults:

    leveldb_write_buffer_size = 32*1024*1024  = 33554432  // 32MB
    leveldb_cache_size        = 512*1024*1204 = 536870912 // 512MB
    leveldb_block_size        = 64*1024       = 65536     // 64KB
    leveldb_compression       = false
    leveldb_log               = ""

  OSDs will still maintain the following osd-specific defaults:

    leveldb_log               = ""

* The 'rados df --format=json' output 'read_bytes' and 'write_bytes'
  fields were incorrectly reporting ops; this is now fixed.

* The 'rados df --format=json' output previously included 'read_kb' and
  'write_kb' fields; these have been removed.  Please use 'read_bytes' and
  'write_bytes' instead (and divide by 1024 if appropriate).
