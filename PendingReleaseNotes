v0.75
~~~~~

- 'rbd ls' on a pool which never held rbd images now exits with code
  0. It outputs nothing in plain format, or an empty list in
  non-plain format. This is consistent with the behavior for a pool
  which used to hold images, but contains none. Scripts relying on
  this behavior should be updated.
