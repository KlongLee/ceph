v11.0.0
-------

* The default monitor port has changed from 6789 to 3300, which has
  been assigned to us by IANA.  Existing monitor will continue to use
  the ports they were created with, while new clusters will default to the
  new port.

  Clients will try first the new port and then the old port if it is
  not explicitly specified, except in one case.  If the monitor
  addresses are specified in the ``ceph.conf`` file by the ``mon
  addr`` option, we will default to the new port and will not try the
  old port as well.  Note that this method specifying monitors is
  deprecated.  Please use ``mon hosts`` in the ``[global]`` section
  instead, or modify the options to explicitly specify the old port
  6789 if needed.
