v0.71
~~~~~

* The MDS now disallows snapshots by default as they are not
  considered stable.  The command 'ceph mds set allow_snaps' will
  enable them.

* For clusters that were created before v0.44 (pre-argonaut, Spring
  2012) and store radosgw data, the auto-upgrade from TMAP to OMAP
  objects has been disabled.  Before upgrading, make sure that any
  buckets created on pre-argonaut releases have been modified (e.g.,
  by PUTing and then DELETEing an object from each bucket).  Any
  cluster created with argonaut (v0.48) or a later release or not
  using radosgw never relied on the automatic conversion and is not
  affected by this change.

* Any direct users of the 'tmap' portion of the librados API should be
  aware that the automatic tmap -> omap conversion functionality has
  been removed.

* Most output that used K or KB (e.g., for kilobyte) now uses a
  lower-case k to match the official SI convention.  Any scripts that
  parse output and check for an upper-case K will need to be modified.

v0.72
~~~~~

* ceph-fuse and radosgw now use the same default values for the admin
  socket and log file paths that the other daemons (ceph-osd,
  ceph-mon, etc.) do.  If you run these daemons as non-root, you may
  need to adjust your ceph.conf to disable these options or to adjust
  the permissions on /var/run/ceph and /var/log/ceph.
