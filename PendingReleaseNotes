~~~~~

* The output of 'ceph status --format=json' or 'ceph -s --format=json'
  has changed to return status information in a more structured and
  usable format.

* The 'ceph pg dump_stuck [threshold]' command used to require a
  --threshold or -t prefix to the threshold argument, but now does
  not.

* Many more ceph commands now output formatted information; select
  with '--format=<format>', where <format> can be 'json', 'json-pretty',
  'xml', or 'xml-pretty'.

* ceph-rest-api, a wrapper around ceph_rest_api.py, can be used to start
  up a test single-threaded HTTP server that provides access to cluster
  information and administration in very similar ways to the ceph
  commandline tool.  ceph_rest_api.py can be used as a WSGI application
  for deployment in a more-capable web server.  See ceph-rest-api.8
  for more.

* The radosgw caps were inconsistently documented to be either 'mon =
  allow r' or 'mon = allow rw'.  The 'mon = allow rw' is required for
  radosgw to create its own pools.  All documentation has been updated
  accordingly.
