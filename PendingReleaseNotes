- The 'osd min down {reporters|reports}' config options have been
  renamed to 'mon osd min down {reporters|reports}', and the
  documentation has been updated to reflect that these options apply
  to the monitors (who process failure reports) and not OSDs.  If you
  have adjusted these settings, please update your ``ceph.conf''
  accordingly.

- New pools now have the HASHPSPOOL flag set by default to provide
  better distribution over OSDs.  Support for this feature was
  introduced in v0.59 and Linux kernel version v3.9.  If you wish to
  access the cluster from an older kernel, set the 'osd pool default
  flag hashpspool = false' option in your ceph.conf prior to creating
  the cluster or creating new pools.  Note that the presense of any
  pool in the cluster with the flag enabled will make the OSD require
  support from all clients.
