v0.73
~~~~~

- As part of fix for #6796, 'ceph osd pool set <pool> <var> <arg>' now
  receives <arg> as an integer instead of a string.  This affects how
  'hashpspool' flag is set/unset: instead of 'true' or 'false', it now
  must be '0' or '1'.

- The behavior of the CRUSH 'indep' choose mode has been changed.  No
  ceph cluster should have been using this behavior unless someone has
  manually extracted a crush map, modified a CRUSH rule to replace
  'firstn' with 'indep', recompiled, and reinjected the new map into
  the cluster.  If the 'indep' mode is currently in use on a cluster,
  the rule should be modified to use 'firstn' instead, and the
  administrator should wait until any data movement completes before
  upgrading.
