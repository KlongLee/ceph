14.2.16
-------

* The structured output of ``ceph status`` or ``ceph -s`` is now more
  concise, particularly the ``mgrmap`` and ``monmap`` sections, and the
  structure of the ``osdmap`` section has been cleaned up.

* MON: The cluster log now logs health detail every ``mon_health_to_clog_interval``,
  which has been changed from 1hr to 10min. Logging of health detail will be
  skipped if there is no change in health summary since last known.


14.2.15
-------

* MGR: progress module can now be turned on/off, using the commands:
  ``ceph progress on`` and ``ceph progress off``.


14.2.13
-------

* This release fixes a regression introduced in 14.2.12 which broke deployments
  that referred to MON hosts using DNS names instead of IP addresses in the
  ``mon_host`` parameter in ``/etc/ceph/ceph.conf``.
