* ceph-osd now requires a max fd limit of at least
  filestore_wbthrottle_(xfs|btrfs)_inodes_hard_limit (5000 by default)
  in order to accomodate the new write back throttle system.  upstart
  now sets the fd limit to 32k.  sysvinit will set it to 32k by default
  (still overrideable via max_open_files).

* The 'ceph pg <pgid> ...' commands (like 'ceph pg <pgid> query') are
  deprecated in favor of 'ceph tell <pgid> ...'.  This makes the
  distinction between 'ceph pg <command> <pgid>' and 'ceph pg <pgid>
  <command>' less awkward by making it clearer that the 'tell'
  commands are talking to the OSD serving the placement group, not the
  monitor.
