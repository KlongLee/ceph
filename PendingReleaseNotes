* 'ceph osd crush set <id> <weight> <loc..>' no longer adds the osd to the
  specified location, as that's a job for 'ceph osd crush add'.  It will
  however continue to work just the same as long as the osd already exists
  in the crush map.

* The OSD now enforces that class write methods cannot both mutate an
  object and return data.  The rbd.assign_bid method, the lone
  offender, has been removed.  This breaks compatibility with
  pre-bobtail librbd clients by preventing them from creating new
  images.

* librados now returns on commit instead of ack for synchronous calls.
  This is a bit safer in the case where both OSDs and the client crash, and
  is probably how it should have been acting from the beginning. Users are
  unlikely to notice but it could result in lower performance in some
  circumstances. Those who care should switch to using the async interfaces,
  which let you specify safety semantics precisely.

* The C++ librados AioComplete::get_version() method was incorrectly
  returning an int (usually 32-bits).  To avoid breaking library
  compatibility, a get_version64() method is added that returns the
  full-width value.  The old method is deprecated and will be removed
  in a future release.  Users of the C++ librados API that make use of
  the get_version() method should modify their code to avoid getting a
  value that is truncated from 64 to to 32 bits.
