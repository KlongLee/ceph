v0.67
~~~~~

* ceph-osd now requires a max fd limit of at least
  filestore_wbthrottle_(xfs|btrfs)_inodes_hard_limit (5000 by default)
  in order to accomodate the new write back throttle system.  upstart
  now sets the fd limit to 32k.  sysvinit will set it to 32k by default
  (still overrideable via max_open_files).
