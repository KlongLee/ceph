~~~~~

* The output of 'ceph status --format=json' or 'ceph -s --format=json'
  has changed to return status information in a more structured and
  usable format.

* The 'ceph pg dump_stuck [threshold]' command used to require a
  --threshold or -t prefix to the threshold argument, but now does
  not.

* Many more ceph commands now output formatted information; select
  with '--format=<format>', where <format> can be 'json', 'json-pretty',
  'xml', or 'xml-pretty'.

* ceph-rest-api, a wrapper around ceph_rest_api.py, can be used to start
  up a test single-threaded HTTP server that provides access to cluster
  information and administration in very similar ways to the ceph
  commandline tool.  ceph_rest_api.py can be used as a WSGI application
  for deployment in a more-capable web server.  See ceph-rest-api.8
  for more.

* The radosgw caps were inconsistently documented to be either 'mon =
  allow r' or 'mon = allow rw'.  The 'mon = allow rw' is required for
  radosgw to create its own pools.  All documentation has been updated
  accordingly.

* rgw copy object operation may return extra progress info during the
  operation. At this point it will only happen when doing cross zone
  copy operations. The S3 response will now return extra <Progress>
  field under the <CopyResult> container. The Swift response will
  now send the progress as a json array.
