~~~~~

* ceph-fuse and radosgw now use the same default values for the admin
  socket and log file paths that the other daemons (ceph-osd,
  ceph-mon, etc.) do.  If you run these daemons as non-root, you may
  need to adjust your ceph.conf to disable these options or to adjust
  the permissions on /var/run/ceph and /var/log/ceph.
