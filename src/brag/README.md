# Ceph-brag

`ceph-brag` is going to be an anonymized cluster reporting tool designed to collect a "registry" of Ceph clusters for community knowledge.
This data will be displayed on a public web page using UUID by default, but users can claim their cluster and publish information about ownership if they so desire.
