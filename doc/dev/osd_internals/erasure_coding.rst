==============================
Erasure Coded Placement Groups
==============================

The documentation of the erasure coding implementation in Ceph was
created in July 2013. It is included in Ceph even before erasure
coding is available because it drives a number of architectural
changes. It is meant to be updated to reflect the `progress of these
architectural changes <http://tracker.ceph.com/issues/4929>`_, up to
the point where it becomes a reference of the erasure coding
implementation itself.
